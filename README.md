# DECISION-TREE-IN-R
This is a "Decision Tree". This decision tree is made by me on R Programming language. Decision Tree help you to take decision according to the giving data or information.A decision tree is a machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression. In this model, loan default (df) is predicted based on age and credit debt (creddebt). The tree first splits on creddebt < 5.6, followed by age-based conditions. Higher credit debt and younger age groups indicate a higher default risk (e.g., 0.72 probability), while lower debt and older age groups have a lower risk (0.11 probability). This model helps in identifying high-risk loan applicants efficiently.
